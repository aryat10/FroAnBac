# FroAndBac

## Overview

Welcome to the **FroAndBac** repository! This repo is designed as a learning task to understand the connection between the frontend and backend parts of a website. It demonstrates how to integrate a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend using Vite for the frontend build tool.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains two main folders:

1. **Backend**
2. **Frontend**

### Backend

- **Purpose**: Serves as the backend server using Express.js.
- **Files**: Contains `server.js`, which includes an API endpoint to serve jokes.
- **Setup**:
  1. Navigate to the `Backend` folder.
  2. Run `npm init` to create the `node_modules` folder.
  3. Install required dependencies by running `npm install express`.

### Frontend

- **Purpose**: Serves as the frontend application using React and Vite.
- **Files**: Contains `app.jsx`, which fetches and displays jokes from the backend.
- **Setup**:
  1. Navigate to the `Frontend` folder.
  2. Run `npm init` to create the `node_modules` folder.
  3. Install required dependencies by running `npm install react react-dom vite`.

## Functionality

In this task:

- The **Backend** folder's `server.js` file contains an array of jokes and an API endpoint that serves these jokes using a callback function.
- The **Frontend** folder's `app.jsx` file fetches the jokes from the backend and displays them.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FroAndBac.git
